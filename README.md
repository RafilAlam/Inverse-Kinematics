# 🦿 2D IK Leg Simulator  
🧠 **Simulating Biomechanics with Code**  
> A real-time inverse kinematics simulation built using **Python and Pygame**, where a 2-joint leg dynamically follows the mouse cursor. It visualizes how a thigh and calf might bend naturally toward a target position — a foundational concept in animation, robotics, and biomechanics.

## 🧠 Features
- Real-time inverse kinematics with mouse tracking  
- Simulated upper and lower leg joints (2-link system)  
- Accurate knee position computation using vector math  
- Smooth joint articulation using geometric constraints  
- Fully rendered in **Pygame**, using `draw.polygon()` for limbs
